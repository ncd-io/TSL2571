The TSL2571 family of devices provides ambient light sensing (ALS) that approximates human eye response to light intensity under a variety of lighting conditions and through a variety of attenuation materials. The Mini Module form factor delivered by NCD is ideal for rapid prototyping and hobbyist applications, employing a simple I2C connector to make this device more accessible on all computing platforms.
